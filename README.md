This is a simple Memory Game where players flip cards to find matching pairs. The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
**Clone the repository** or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Open index.html in a web browser to play the game.
Click on any card to flip it over and reveal its value.
Try to find matching pairs by flipping over two cards at a time.
If the two flipped cards match, they will stay face up. If they do not match, they will flip back after a short delay.
Continue until all pairs are found.
Click the "Restart Game" button to reset the game and shuffle the cards.
